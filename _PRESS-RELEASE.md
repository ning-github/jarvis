There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
<!-- 
> Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
 -->
   Your Superhero Personal Assistant

## Sub-Heading ##
<!-- 
> Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
 -->
   Fast, dependable access to your favorite heroes in one place and in one click.

## Summary ##
<!-- 
> Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
 -->
   There are a lot of superheroes and it can be an overwhelming task to obtain consolidated information on any particular hero in one place, both for new fans and veteran readers. In either case, chances are that if a person is searching for a character, they would like to find the information quickly, rather than gather it on their own after visiting several different sources. There has to be a better way.
    That better way is Jarvis. Simply tell Jarvis what character you want to know more about, and Jarvis will provide you with that information in one place. 

## Problem ##
<!-- 
> Describe the problem your product solves.
 -->
   Superhero bios are scattered across multiple storylines and resources on the web.

## Solution ##
<!-- 
> Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
 -->
   Draws on form input to immediately provide you with a page detailing organized information on the submitted character in one place.  

## Quote from You ##
<!-- 
> A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
 -->
   "Just watched a superhero movie and want to learn more about that hero? But what's that? You don't want to wade through 7 different websites? 
   Save the day with Jarvis. Just tell Jarvis who you're interested in and he'll deliver that character's information instantly in a single digestable form." - Professor Charles Francis Xavier

## How to Get Started ##
<!-- 
> Describe how easy it is to get started.
 -->
   Just type a character's name into the search bar and Jarvis will take care of the rest.

## Customer Quote ##
<!-- 
> Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
 -->
   "I loved the new Avengers movie so much that I wanted to host an Avengers trivia night at my local comic book shop. Jarvis made researching and designing questions both smooth and fun! Did you know that it was Hank Pym that actually created Ultron and not Tony Stark? I didn't, but Jarvis did!" - Ann from Albuquerque

## Closing and Call to Action ##
<!-- 
> Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
 -->
   If you want to learn about Captain America, Wolverine, and Spider-Man:
   
   You could do a separate google search for each and navigate search results for each
   
   OR
   
   you could have Jarvis take care of that for you! Less time sifting, more time learning!
